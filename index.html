                    <p>
                        Meet Gary, your go-to coding teacher on a mission to
                        demystify the world of web development! With a passion
                        for teaching and a knack for making complex concepts
                        easy to understand, Gary is here to be your compass in
                        the vast universe of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Gary's Teaching Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gary believes that coding is not just about memorizing
                        syntax; it's about understanding the logic behind it. In
                        his classes, you won't find mind-numbing lectures but
                        rather engaging sessions that foster curiosity and
                        critical thinking. He encourages questions, discussions,
                        and hands-on coding to ensure that his students truly
                        grasp the essence of web development.
                    </p>

                            </a>

                                Gary starts with the basics‚ÄîHTML. He emphasizes
                                the importance of a strong foundation, comparing
                                HTML to the skeleton of a web page. Through
                                Gary's guidance, students learn how to structure
                                content, create links, and use semantic elements
                                for better accessibility. By the end of the HTML
                                module, his students are already building the
                                skeletal structure of functional web pages.

                                Next up, Gary introduces the magic wand of web
                                design‚ÄîCSS. With a touch of creativity, Gary
                                shows his students how to bring their web pages
                                to life. From styling fonts and colors to
                                understanding layout principles, he ensures that
                                his students not only make visually appealing
                                websites but also write clean and efficient CSS
                                code.

                                In the world of Gary, JavaScript isn't just a
                                programming language; it's the wizardry that
                                makes your websites interactive. Gary takes his
                                students on a journey of coding adventures,
                                teaching them how to manipulate the Document
                                Object Model (DOM), handle events, and create
                                dynamic content. By the time they finish the
                                JavaScript module, Gary's students are weaving
                                spells of interactivity into their web
                                creations.

                                What sets Gary apart is his commitment to
                                real-world applications. He sprinkles practical
                                examples and coding challenges throughout his
                                courses, ensuring that his students don't just
                                learn theory but can apply their knowledge to
                                solve problems. Whether it's building a
                                portfolio website, a responsive design, or a
                                small interactive game, Gary's students graduate
                                with hands-on experience.
